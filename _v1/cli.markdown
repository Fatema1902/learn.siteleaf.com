The Siteleaf v1 CLI and Ruby Gem is not compatible with v2 sites (and vice versa), so we recommend using a [Gemfile](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html) to allow both versions to be installed.

For documentation on the v1 CLI, see: 
**<https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-gem/tree/v1>** &rarr;

For information on the v2 CLI, see:
