If your site needs to support multiple languages, you have several solutions available:

1) Create multiple versions of your pages (in each language). For example:

`/en/about.markdown -> /en/about/`
`/fr/about.markdown -> /fr/about/`

2) Use JavaScript and perform translations client-side ([as pointed out here](https://gist.github.com/sskylar/8524524)).
